On similar lines let's create a very basic chatbot utlising the Python's NLTK library.It's a very simple bot with hardly any cognitive skills,but still a good way to get into NLP and get to know about chatbots.

## Motivation
The idea of this project was not to create some SOTA chatbot with exceptional cognitive skills but just to utilise and test my Python skills.if any greeting message is used to interact with bot then bot use predified data to reply and if message is not greeting the bot searches the wikipedia corpus ,get the consine similarity and respond .




## Pre-requisites
**NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit)**

[Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/) provides a practical introduction to programming for language processing.

For platform-specific instructions, read [here](https://www.nltk.org/install.html)

### Installation of NLTK
```
pip install nltk
```
### Installing required packages
After NLTK has been downloaded, install required packages
```
import nltk
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
nltk.download('popular', quiet=True) # for downloading popular packages
nltk.download('punkt') 
nltk.download('wordnet') 

```
## Telegram Token
Please replace the telegram token variable value with your own telegram token

## How to run
